        <p>The solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and other space objects like asteroids and comets. The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Neptune is eighth and farthest planet from the sun. It is known for it's unique deep blue color. The reason why it is blue is because of the presence of methane in it's atmosphere. </p>

        <p> Isaac Newton's orbital thought experiment features a cannon firing a projectile at increasing speeds. At low speeds, the cannon would fall back to Earth but as the speed increases, it would travel farther and it would enter a point in which it would orbit around Earth. This is known as orbital velocity. In orbital mechanics, periapsis is the closest point in an orbit to the central body while apoapsis is the farthest point. These points represent the elliptical form of most orbits.   </p>
